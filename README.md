# Idea
A game where you wake up and you do everyday tasks, and based on how fast and well you do them is your score

chores:
- laundry folding
- dishes away
- cleaning table
- homework

first task to implement will be `cleaning table` as you can just put random `items` on tables then sort them away and that can be the minigame.

base systems:
- a time counter, every hour or two can be a task to do
- a minigame loading system
- a ending screen to show how well you did
- menu
- minigame can be an enum
